# GP_Smart_WallBox_Charger_For_EV
This Project has 2 ECUs using STM32F103, The first represents all the charger unit that consists of (AC input, Rectifier, DC DC Converter, Relays,Transistors and MCU (stm32f103), temperature, volt, and current sensor. We make it smart by using Esp8266 (wifi Module) to connect with server (website) which connects with MCU by UART Communication Protocol for showing fields as (charging state, volt value, current and temperature ), also display all these values on TFT display upper charger which connects with MCU by SPI communications protocol. The second ECU represents the EV which responsible for setting its state between it and the charger by putting different load on pilot wire and sending the start signal for charging.  Control Pilot is the main communicating wire between the charger and EV. The charger generates 1 kHz, +-12 signal and is transmitted to Electric vehicle through this control pilot (CP) interface. The vehicle respond it by placing different load (resistor) on the line which affects its voltage level which is responded back to the charger.  We implemented all software drivers from scratch (RCC, GPIO, ADC, PWM,Systick, ESP8266, UART, SPI, TFT, Temperature, Volt )
